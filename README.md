Works with GitLab, too. Just tell them it's like GitHub with blue squares.

## Why?

Because I saw and shared [this](https://twitter.com/EmilyKager/status/1277983791190085632):

And [@PeteMarkowsky](https://twitter.com/PeteMarkowsky) was like:

> re: green squares has anyone released a github action that just does a commit to a private repo as you

So I made this.

## How?

- Make a 53x7 image of whatever you want
- Node.js v12 or later or something I don't know
- `yarn install`
- Include private contributions in your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) to up your green square game
- Make a private repo on GitHub to hide your secrets
- Run `node index.js image.png ~/game git@github.com:yourname/yourrepo.git` and git push force origin
- Bask in the glory of your new resume-crushing GitHub profile

## It doesn't work?

- Fiddle with the `MAX_COMMITS` environment variable or something
- Delete, re-create the private repo, and push again
- Wait a few minutes

I made this before seeing the above projects.

Also, this version uses `git fast-import` to create a git repo, which is üî•
